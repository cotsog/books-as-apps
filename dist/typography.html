      <h1>Learning to play with typography</h1>

      <p>Over the past few months I've rekindled my interest in typography; how it works in print and also how it works online. I'm also working through two typography books that are very relevant to both typographic work and overall front end design and development. <a href="http://oreil.ly/1QuoKut">Responsive Typography</a> by Jason Pamental and <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/on-web-typography">On web typography</a> by Jason Santa Maria</p>

      <p>But it wasn't until fluent that I got a better idea of why typography is important.I got the chance to talk with both Eric Meyer, one of my early web design influences, and Jason Pamental, the author of Responsive Typography and a very good presenter.</p>

      <p>What I got out of multiple presentations about CSS, typography and new technologies coming and going away (saddly) is that the basics are still important. With that in mind I'll look at typography through a series of exercises. The exercises can be edited and will change the display of the associated text; you can then copy and paste the resulting CSS to your own CSS/SCSS stylesheet.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The first thing to learn is that all typefaces are different. What works for the typefaces I chose may or may not work for the typefaces you choose for your projects. Where possible I'll show the typefaces used in this page against other typefaces (most likely from the 'web safe' font set.)</p>

        <h2>Font Selection</h2>

        <h3>Font stacks</h3>

        <p>Unless you're using one of the universal fonts, those available everywhere, you will most likely have to plan for what happens if your browser cannot load the font because your internet connection just died or you got caught using a font that you were not licensed to use. That's where you use the font stack.</p>

        <p>At its simplest, the stack is the list of fonts that you want to use in your page going from left to right. For example in the following font stack:</p>

        <pre><code class='css'>html {
  font-family: 'Museo Sans', Verdana, sans-serif;
}</code></pre>

        <p>The browser will use Museo Sans, if is available in a format that the browser can read, if it isn't then the browser will use Verdana and... in the unlikely event that verdana is not available the browser will use the system's default sans serif font.</p>

        <p>Why is this important, you may be asking. Because not all fonts are the same. Even fonts that look very similar may be different enough to cause problems with your layout. Let's look at the same Lorem Ipsum text in two different fonts.

          <p>The first example will use Stone Humanist, the font I chose for the body text.</p>

<div class="css-example">
            <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

div#example1 {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  font-family: 'Stone-Humanist', sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.3;
  margin-top: 1em;
  padding: 1em
}
          </style>

          <div id='example1'>
            <p>Bacon ipsum dolor amet sint t-bone et aliquip proident ex dolor. Landjaeger tail duis, nostrud brisket strip steak shankle turducken. Laborum sausage aliqua, non quis laboris est brisket reprehenderit ball tip cow capicola. Meatloaf commodo jerky adipisicing.</p>
            <p>Ad short ribs adipisicing, lorem beef elit eiusmod laborum pork belly labore. Aliqua jowl id, ut cupim in swine short ribs. Nulla short loin enim drumstick in, minim rump pancetta. Fatback qui corned beef, strip steak spare ribs elit minim pig. Cupidatat aliquip pariatur, pork belly tenderloin flank cillum.</p>
          </div>
</div>
         <p>Example usinng Stone Humanist</p>

          <p>The second example uses <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Verdana">Verdana</a>, a font created for and released by Microsoft in 1996.</p>

<div class="css-example">
            <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

div#example2 {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.3;
  margin-top: 1em;
  padding: 1em;
}
          </style>
          <div id='example2'>
            <p>Bacon ipsum dolor amet sint t-bone et aliquip proident ex dolor. Landjaeger tail duis, nostrud brisket strip steak shankle turducken. Laborum sausage aliqua, non quis laboris est brisket reprehenderit ball tip cow capicola. Meatloaf commodo jerky adipisicing.</p>
            <p>Ad short ribs adipisicing, lorem beef elit eiusmod laborum pork belly labore. Aliqua jowl id, ut cupim in swine short ribs. Nulla short loin enim drumstick in, minim rump pancetta. Fatback qui corned beef, strip steak spare ribs elit minim pig. Cupidatat aliquip pariatur, pork belly tenderloin flank cillum.</p>
          </div>

</div>
                   <p>Example using Verdana</p>

          <p>Notice, in particular, how Verdana's characters are wider and therefore make the line have less content when compared with Stone Humanist. As a further experiment change the front in Example 2-2 from Verdana to Arial and see the difference.</p>

          <h3>&quot;Web Safe&quot; Fonts</h3>

          <p>Ever since browsers started using fonts they;ve been able to use fonts available on the user's system. These are the &quot;web safe&quot; fonts.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.cssfontstack.com/">CSS Font Stack</a> presents a list of some of the most common desktop fonts that are installed in Macintosh and Windows operating systems. As you can see there are a few fonts that are really safe to use across platforms.</p>

          <p>This is yet another consideration when building our font stack. If we build backups other than generic fonts we need to be careful to pick fonts that are wide used or pick 2 or more options to cover both Windows and Macintosh cases.</p>

          <h3>Generic font families</h3>

          <p>Most of the time we have a certain font selected for our project and most of the time they will work ok. But what happens when they don't?</p>

          <p>As we saw in the earlier examples the typeface you choose will affect number of words you can fit in a line of text and the way the font writes on screen may look different with the same line height </p>

          <p>CSS defines a number of generic font families for use with your content. These families are (with defnitions taken from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/">CSS 2.1</a> specification):</p>

          <dl>
            <dt><strong>serif</strong></dt>
            <dd>Glyphs of serif fonts, as the term is used in CSS, tend to have finishing strokes, flared or tapering ends, or have actual serifed (including slab serifs). Serif fonts are typically proportionately-spaced. They often display a greater variation between thick and thin strokes than fonts from the 'sans-serif' generic font family. CSS uses the term 'serif' to apply to a font for any script, although other names may be more familiar for particular scripts, such as Mincho (Japanese), Sung or Song (Chinese), Totum or Kodig (Korean). Any font that is so described may be used to represent the generic 'serif' family.</dd>

            <dt><strong>sans-serif</strong></dt>
            <dd>Glyphs in sans-serif fonts, as the term is used in CSS, tend to have stroke endings that are plain -- with little or no flaring, cross stroke, or other ornamentation. Sans-serif fonts are typically proportionately-spaced. They often have little variation between thick and thin strokes, compared to fonts from the 'serif' family. CSS uses the term 'sans-serif' to apply to a font for any script, although other names may be more familiar for particular scripts, such as Gothic (Japanese), Kai (Chinese), or Pathang (Korean). Any font that is so described may be used to represent the generic 'sans-serif' family.</dd>

            <dt><strong>cursive</strong></dt>
            <dd>Glyphs in cursive fonts, as the term is used in CSS, generally have either joining strokes or other cursive characteristics beyond those of italic typefaces. The glyphs are partially or completely connected, and the result looks more like handwritten pen or brush writing than printed letterwork. Fonts for some scripts, such as Arabic, are almost always cursive. CSS uses the term 'cursive' to apply to a font for any script, although other names such as Chancery, Brush, Swing and Script are also used in font names.</dd>

            <dt><strong>fantasy</strong></dt>
            <dd>Fantasy fonts, as used in CSS, are primarily decorative while still containing representations of characters (as opposed to Pi or Picture fonts, which do not represent characters).</dd>

            <dt><strong>monospace</strong></dt>
            <dd>The sole criterion of a monospace font is that all glyphs have the same fixed width. (This can make some scripts, such as Arabic, look most peculiar.) The effect is similar to a manual typewriter, and is often used to set samples of computer code.</dd>
          </dl>

          <p>Using a generic family as the last item in your font stack is always a good idea. The system is guaranteed to be available and you can style your content with this consideration in mind. It also makes your CSS less succeptuble to slow connections or network failures.</p>

          <h3>Additional Considerations</h3>

          <p>There are a couple more elements to consider when selecting a font. They may not seem as important but when put together with evcerything else we'll discuss in this page, it's a lot more important than we give it credit for.</p>

          <h4>Font size</h4>

          <p>Even when working with Desktop Operating Systems alone a font may look very different. It doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the design and all with how the operating system renders fonts and it may not even happen but this is something to consider when testing.</p>

          <p>Fonts become even more complicated when we factor mobile devices into the mix, particularly since Apple released 'Retina' iPhones and iPads and Android phones have been released with even higher pixel density.</p>

          <figure>
            <img src="images/font-in-chrome-mac.png">
            <figcaption>This page displayed during development in Chrome for OSX</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure>
            <img src="images/font-in-spartan-win-vm.png">
            <figcaption>Content displayed in Microsoft Edge running in a Windows 10 virtual machine</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h4>Line height</h4>

          <p>In CSS line-height control the vertical space between lines. It can help readability and make it easier for people with dissabilities to engage with your content. </p>

          <pre><code class='css'>p {
  font: 1em/1.5 arial, helvetica, sans-serif;
}</code></pre>

          <p>Which is equivalent to this, much more verbose, syntax:</p>

          <pre><code class='css'>p {
  font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1em;
  line-height: 1.5;
}</code></pre>

          <p>I personally prefer the second syntax. It's explicit in telling you what each attribute controls and it saves you from having to remember what does each part of the expression means. That said you're more than welcome to use either syntax.</p>

          <p>So why do we care about line height. In the example below change the line height attribute, play with values from 1 to 2 or even 3 and see the difference. Which one is more comfortable to read?</p>

<div class="css-example">
            <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

div#example3 {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif;
  font-size: 1em;
  line-height: 1.3;
  padding: 1em;
}
          </style>

          <div id='example3'>
            <p>Bacon ipsum dolor amet sint t-bone et aliquip proident ex dolor. Landjaeger tail duis, nostrud brisket strip steak shankle turducken. Laborum sausage aliqua, non quis laboris est brisket reprehenderit ball tip cow capicola. Meatloaf commodo jerky adipisicing.</p>
            <p>Ad short ribs adipisicing, lorem beef elit eiusmod laborum pork belly labore. Aliqua jowl id, ut cupim in swine short ribs. Nulla short loin enim drumstick in, minim rump pancetta. Fatback qui corned beef, strip steak spare ribs elit minim pig. Cupidatat aliquip pariatur, pork belly tenderloin flank cillum.</p>
          </div>
</div>
          <p>Example demonstrating what happens when you change line-height</p>

          <h3>So what should the stack look like?</h3>

          <p>So, after all these conversations about different types of typefaces, fonts, availability and when to use and not to use them, what should a good font stack look like?</p>

          <p>As with many thing in the web it depends. If you were given fonts as part of your design brief then you should follup up with the designer regarding fall back fonts.</p>

          <p>If this is your design then I'd suggest sites like <a href="http://fontsinuse.com/">Fonts in use</a> or <a href="http://www.typewolf.com/">Typewolf</a> to see how other people are using fonts. Another way is to identify a font you like (like I did with the body font for this page), research whether it's available as a web font and how much would it cost to license.</p>

        <p>Once you know what font you want to use, there are services like <a href="http://typecast.com/">Typecast</a> to see what the font will look like in an actuall web page... you can even add chunks of your own content to get a more acurate picture of what the typeface will look like with <em>your</em> content.</p>

        <p>My default font stack for this project looks like this:</p>

        <pre><code class="css">html {
  font-family: 'Stone-Humanist', arial, sans-serif;
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>I use a different stack for headings and this will be discussed when we talk about <a href="#headings">headings</a> in more detail.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Loading Fonts</h2>

        <p>Now that we have a better idea of what fonts we want to use and the font stack we'll see how to load them into the page. We'll explore 3 ways: local loading using the <em>@font-face syntax</em>, loading fonts using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started">Google font API</a> and using Google's <a href="https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader/blob/master/README.md">Web Font Loader</a></p>

        <h3>@font-face </h3>

        <p>We have been able to use fonts on our web contetn since the days of IE 3 (3,5 for Macintosh if I remember correctly) but we've always had to contend with font creators and foundries fear of piracy. It's only recently that they have relented and allowed their fonts to be used. The basic syntax, covering all modern browsers, looks like this:</p>


        <pre><code class="css">@font-face {
    font-family: 'stone-sans-webfont';
    src: url('../path-to-font-file.eot');
    src: url('../path-to-font-file.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
         url('../path-to-font-file.woff2') format('woff2'),
         url('../path-to-font-file.woff') format('woff'),
         url('../path-to-font-file.ttf') format('truetype'),
         url('../path-to-font-file.svg#stone-sans-webfont') format('svg');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
}</code></pre>

        <p>And then we associate the font with CSS like we normally would matching the font-family attribute in the @font-face declaration with the font-family attribute of the element where we want to use it:</p>

        <pre><code class="css">html {
        font-family: 'stone-sans-webfont', arial, sans-serif;
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>Since we want to avoid faux bold and faux italics in our content, we add the bold and italics versions of our font to the page and then match them to the correct attributes with selectors similar to this:</p>

        <pre><code class="css">strong {
  font-family: 'Stone-Humanist-Semi';
}

em {
  font-family: 'Stone-Humanist-Ita';
}

/*
  When using both we don't care what order they are used in
*/
strong em,
em strong {
  font-family: 'Stone-Humanist-SemiItalic';
}
</code></pre>

        <p>Where <em>Stone-Humanist-Semi</em> is our (semi)bold font, <em>Stone-Humanist-Ita</em> is italics and <em>Stone-Humanist-SemiItalic</em> is the semibold italics combination. Since <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> have different semantic meaning in HTML5 I've chosen not to style them.</p>

        <h4>Some things to keep in mind</h4>

        <p>Adding the font to your site/book/app adds to the overall file size. Depending on the font this may increase the size of your project considerably. Takng <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=gentium">Gentium</a> as an example, the font supports Latin, Greek and Cyrillic character sets but it weight a hefty 500k for the regular font (in one format out of the 5 formats needed to support multiple browsers/devices). Add Bold, Italic and you get 1.5 Megabytes just for the font! And it may not be the only font you use in the project. </p>

        <p>The flipside to this issue of size is that embedding the fonts means they are always available to desktop and mobile browsers readers that support embedding (and it should be all of them.) Choosing what browsers and what versions to support is a different story.</p>

        <h3>Google Fonts API</h3>

        <p>Google has two ways of using web fonts, the first one is directly through their API. Using Google's font API is a two step process. First add the font to your html head element with the following syntax (using Tangerine as an example):</p>

        <pre><code class="html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Tangerine"></code></pre>

        <p>The link produces a CSS @font-face declaration that we can use in our CSS as normal. The version produced in Chrome and Firefox uses the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF2/">woff2</a> format</p>

        <pre><code class="css">@font-face {
  font-family: 'Tangerine';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Tangerine'), url(http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/tangerine/v6/HGfsyCL5WASpHOFnouG-RJBw1xU1rKptJj_0jans920.woff2) format('woff2');
  unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02C6, U+02DA, U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2212, U+2215, U+E0FF, U+EFFD, U+F000;
}</code></pre>

        <p>While Safari uses True Type to render the font.</p>

        <pre><code class="css">@font-face {
  font-family: 'Tangerine';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Tangerine'), url(http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/tangerine/v6/HGfsyCL5WASpHOFnouG-RCZ2oysoEQEeKwjgmXLRnTc.ttf) format('truetype');
}</code></pre>

        <p>As you can see the advantage of using the APi is that we don't need to use multiple formats in our @font-face declaration. Google takes care of that for us.</p>

        <p>The obvoius disadvantage is that this only works online. That's why a fallback option or options is even more important when working with the API. If we're offline or connectivity is limited we want a good fallback font.</p>

        <h3>Google web font loader</h3>

        <p>One of the things neither the font API or directly downloading the content doesn't address is the "flash of unstyled text." According to the <a href="http://help.typekit.com/customer/portal/articles/6852-Controlling-the-Flash-of-Unstyled-Text-or-FOUT-using-Font-Events">Typekit Help Center</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Fonts are loaded as assets into a web page—just like images or video. Depending on your browser or your connection speed, they can load quickly or lag behind the rest of the page. Different browsers handle font loading differently; for example, Safari and Chrome will refrain from displaying text set in a web font until the font has loaded, while Internet Explorer won’t show anything on the page until the font loads. Meanwhile, Firefox will display the site with the fallback fonts in the font stack, and then switch to the linked fonts after they’ve finished loading. This results in a flash of unstyled text, or FOUT.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Typekit, in collaboration with Google, has created loader library to make working with type easier. It works by adding scripts to the page that load the library and tell it what fonts to download and use. For example to load the Droid Sans font from Google you'd use code like this:</p>

        <pre><code class="html">&lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1.5.10/webfont.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script>
  WebFont.load({
    typekit: {
      id: 'xxxxxx'
    },
    custom: {
      families: ['Droid Sans', 'Source Code Pro'],
    },
    google: {
      families: ['Droid Sans', 'Droid Serif'],
      text: 'abcdedfghijklmopqrstuvwxyz!'
    },
    fontdeck: {
      id: 'xxxxx'
    },
    monotype: {
      projectId: 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx',
      version: 12345 // (optional, flushes the CDN cache)
    }
  });
&lt;/script></code></pre>

      <p>For an explanation of the values for each foundry check the Font Loader's <a href="https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader/blob/master/README.md">readme file</a> in Github.</p>

      <p>The font loader creates a set of events, both CSS and Javascript, for developers to interact with. This is similar to the way Modernizr handles feature detection. The Javascript classes are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>loading - This event is triggered when all fonts have been requested.</li>
        <li>active - This event is triggered when the fonts have rendered.</li>
        <li>inactive - This event is triggered when the browser does not support linked fonts or if none of the fonts could be loaded.</li>
        <li>fontloading - This event is triggered once for each font that's loaded.</li>
        <li>fontactive - This event is triggered once for each font that renders.</li>
        <li>fontinactive - This event is triggered if the font can't be loaded.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>CSS events are implemented as classes on the html element. The following classes are set on the html element and correspond to the descriptions above:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>.wf-loading</li>
          <li>.wf-active</li>
          <li>.wf-inactive</li>
          <li>.wf-&lt;familyname>-&lt;fvd>-loading</li>
          <li>.wf-&lt;familyname>-&lt;fvd>-active</li>
          <li>.wf-&lt;familyname>-&lt;fvd>-inactive</li>
        </ul>

     <p>The &lt;familyname> placeholder will be replaced by a sanitized version of the name of each font family in lowercase with only alphanumeric characters. For example, Droid Sans becomes droidsans. The &lt;fvd> placeholder is a <a href="http://typekit.github.io/fvd/">Font Variation Description,</a> a shorthand for describing the style and weight of a particular font.</p>


     <h4>So why would we use the Font Loader?</h4>

     <p>In short: to make the user's experience less jarring. Since fonts are downloaded as any other resource in your web page. If we use the following font stack: <code>'stone-sans-webfont', arial, sans-serif</code>, we can then use the Font Loader Defined classes to make the transition to our fonts smoother and better looking. Let's look at one possibility:</p>

     <pre><code class="css">.wf-inactive body{
  font-family: arial, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.4em;
}

.wf-active body {
  font-family: 'stone-sans-webfont', arial, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.3
}
     </code></pre>

     <p><code>.wf-inactive</code> indicates that loading the font or fonts (in this case we are using one) has not started. To make sure that the user doesn't see a system fault we provide a fallback option while the web font(s) are loading. This may be an instant or maybe several seconds in a slow or congested network connection (try Starbucks on a Sunday afternoon.)</p>

     <p>Once the font(s) load, the class will switch to <code>.wf-active</code> where we put out web font stack and attributes related to font. In this case I only added a different line-height attribute to the selector but you can be as detailed as you want.</p>

     <p>One last detail: <strong>What happens if Javascript is disabled?</strong></p>

     <p>If you're fonts are loaded from google you can revert back to useing the Google API to load your fonts. You can do something like:</p>

     <pre><code class="html">&lt;noscript>
  &lt;link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:700italic,300,700,300italic' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
&lt;/noscript></code></pre>

        <h2>Paragraph styling</h2>

        <p>Most the time we spend engaged with text is with paragraphs and that's where I put a lot of my research time when working on a new project. You may be asking why put so much work on how the paragraphs look... As you will see in the example below there are many elements that are involved in controlling paragraph appearance.</p>

<div class="css-example">
    <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

div#example4 {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  padding: 1em;
  width: 100%;
}

div#example4 p:first-child {
  text-indent: 0;
  font-size: 1em;
}
div#example4 p {
  font-family: 'Stone-Humanist', arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1em; /* 1em = 16px */
  line-height: 1.3;
  text-align: left;
  text-indent: 2em;
  letter-spacing: 0;
  word-spacing: 0;

}
          </style>

          <div id='example4'>

                   <p>Playing with paragraph type</p>

                    <p>With the content above we can now start playing with type. Do the following activities to get a feel for how much type can change:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Change the font-size on <code>div#example4 p:first-child</code> to 1.5em</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Does the size of the first paragraph change your reaction to it? Does size matter?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Remove the reference to "Stone Humanist" to see what would the text look like in Arial</li>
            <li>Remove the reference to Arial to see what the text would look like in the system's Sans Serif font</li>
            <ul>
              <li>What are the differences between the three fonts?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Change the font-size attribute to 1.5em and the line-height to 1 Is it harder to read?</li>
            <li>Change the line-height to 1.5. Does it get easier?</li>
            <li>Chang the reference to "Stone Humanist" to Verdana. Can you describe the changes?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Does the line height change how easy or hard it is to read the text?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Change the width attribute of <code>div#example4</code> to 50%</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Does the text become harder to read as it gets narrower?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Change the word spacing from normal to .25em</li>
            <li>Change the word spacing from .25em to -.25em</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Does the text become harder to read as it gets sspread further apart? As it gets condensed together?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Change the letter spacing from 0 to .25em.</li>
            <li>Change the letter spacing from .25em to -.25em</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Does the text become harder to read as it gets sspread further apart? As it gets condensed together?</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>

          <p>The typeface you select does make a difference. While we may not conciously notice how the text changes the changes affect the way text looks and the way we interact with it. I know I hit you with a lot of activities and questions for this little paragraph exercise so feel free to play with some, all or none of the activities above. </p>

          <p>But whether you use them or not, you get the idea of how much work goes into making paragraphs read well.</p>

          <h3>Drop caps</h3>

          <p>Most (if not all) of us have seen the big initial capital letter on the first paragraph of a chapter. We can do th is with CSS. One version of the effect looks like the code below using first--of-type and first-letter to identify the first letter of the first paragraph and the styles to apply to t his pseudo element</p>

          <pre><code class="css">p:first-of-type:first-letter {
  font-size: 3em;
  line-height: 0.9em;
  float: left;
  padding-right: 0.15em;
}
          </code></pre>

    <div class="css-example">
      <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

#dropcap-example {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  padding: 1em;

}

#dropcap-example p:first-of-type:first-letter {
  font-size: 6em;
  line-height: 1.25em;

    <p>Example of drop cap using pseudo classes</p>

    <p>Unfortunately older browsers don't support the :first-of-type selector (looking at IE7 and possibly IE8) so we have to work around and tie the drop cap to the first element. Most of the time this will be an h1 or other heading element but it can be any element you want. If you don't care about supporting older browsers then this is a non-issue but coding defensively is always a good practice :)</p>

          <pre><code class="css">h1 + p:first-letter {

        <h2><a name="headings"></a>Headings</h2>

        <p>Headings serve as the visual representation of our content and, as such, they deserve special consideration. We'll discuss whether to use the same font as our body or whether it's better to use a different one, and some things we can do with heading text. I wish I could tell you exactly what fonts to use but, as with many things type related, it'll depend on many factors.</p>

        <p>Let's look at what the possibilities are. </p>

        <h3>Same or different fontface?</h3>

        <p>One of the questions that always baffles me is whether to use the same font for headings as I use for the body text. </p>

             <h2>Color</h2>

      <p>another aspect to consider is the color for your typefaces. This is a very design-dependent step. Were you given a color palette as part of your design brief? Then use those. But if you're planning your own project then you can use the tools below.</p>

      <p><a href="https://color.adobe.com/">Adobe Color CSS</a> (Formerly known as Adobe Kuler) let's you create color sets for your projects. If you use SASS/SCSS you can then turn the colors into variables to use in your CSS.</p>

      <p>Dudley Storye creataed a <a href="http://demosthenes.info/blog/927/The-New-Defaults-A-Sass-Color-Thesaurus">color Thesaurus</a> that makes it easier to see what the colors will look like in the page. We can combine the colors from the chart with text to test </p>

        <h3>Open Type features</h3>

        <p>Open Type fonts have a set of features that make typographical work easier. These features can be enabled. These are a subset of all the Open Type features available. </p>

        <ul>
          <li>"c2sc" : small caps from caps</li>
          <li>"calt" : contextual alternates</li>
          <li>"clig" : contextual ligatures</li>
          <li>"dlig" : discretionary ligatures</li>
          <li>"hist" : historical character alternatives</li>
          <li>"hlig" : historical ligatures</li>
          <li>"kern" : enable use of embedded kerning table</li>
          <li>"liga" : common ligatures</li>
          <li>"nalt" : alternate annotation</li>
          <li>"salt" : stylistic alternatives</li>
          <li>"smcp" : small caps</li>
          <li>"ss01" : alternate stylistic set 1</li>
          <li>"ss02" : alternate stylistic set 2</li>
          <li>"ss03" : alternate stylistic set 3</li>
          <li>"ss04" : alternate stylistic set 4</li>
          <li>"ss05" : alternate stylistic set 5</li>
          <li>"swsh" : swashes</li>
          <li>"zero" : slashed-zero</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Adobe has <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_tag3.html">more information about Open Type features</a>, both the ones listed above and additional features used in desktop publishing. When in doubt use the name above to check Adobe's list.</p>

        <p>To enable these features in CSS use something like the code below:</p>

        <pre><code class=css>body {
  font-feature-settings:
    "c2sc" 0,
    "calt" 1,
    "clig" 1,
    "dlig" 1,
    "frac" 0,
    "hist" 0,
    "hlig" 0,
    "kern" 0,
    "liga" 1,
    "nalt" 0,
    "salt" 1,
    "ss01" 0,
    "ss02" 0,
    "ss03" 0,
    "ss04" 0,
    "ss05" 0,
    "swsh" 0,
    "zero" 0;
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>This feature is a prime candidate for autoprefixer or some other automation tool. Repeating the same sequence of value-pair for 3 or 4 different alternatives is a nightmare; according to <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=font-feature-settings">caniuse.com</a>, Only IE, Chrome/Opera and Firefox support the feature and Chrome/Opera support it behind the -webkit flag.</p>

        <h2>One final thing</h2>

        <p>For those of us who have been playing in/with 'the web' for 10 years or longer remember pages like the ones in figures 9-1, 9-2 and 9-3. There was no Javascript and, I believe, the original CSS specification was released in 1996 so there really was no CSS to play with.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Mosaic_Netscape_0.9_on_Windows_XP.png">

        <p>Why do I bring this up? Because we've gotten spoiled by reaches. We talk about critical rendering path, page load and web typography and that's good. But we forget that what may be an acceptable page load in Mountain View, California may not be acceptable in Thailand where the dominant form of Internet access is the mobile smart phone (<a href="http://www.techwireasia.com/1152/mobile-internet-users-up-40pc-in-thailand-iphone-dominant/">Tech Wire Asia</a>).</p>

        <p>As Eric Meyer reminds us the web is more than just Javascript, CSS and the latest and greates APIs or micro services. We need to make sure that the content is accessible whether we have CSS and Javascript enabled or whether they are in a broadband Gigabit connection or in a very slow dial up connection in Africa or India or for people using assistive technology devices.</p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r38al1w-h4k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>As content developers we need to continually ask ourselves what would happen if we can't download the CSS or if the user has Javascript disabled. We need to make this a part of our testing and development process.</p>

        <blockquote cite="http://simplyaccessible.com/article/data-attributes/">
          <p>In the web front-end stack — HTML, CSS, JS, and ARIA — if you can solve a problem with a simpler solution lower in the stack, you should. It’s less fragile, more foolproof, and just works.</p>
