      <h1><a name='playground'></a>Typography Playground</h1>

      <p>Over the past few months I've rekindled my interest in typography; how it works in print and also how it works online. I'm also working through two typography books that are very relevant to both typographic work and overall front end design and development. <a href="http://oreil.ly/1QuoKut">Responsive Typography</a> by Jason Pamental and <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/on-web-typography">On web typography</a> by Jason Santa Maria</p>

      <p>But it wasn't until fluent that I got a better idea of why typography is important.I got the chance to talk with both Eric Meyer, one of my early web design influences, and Jason Pamental, the author of Responsive Typography and a very good presenter.</p>

      <p>What I got out of multiple presentations about CSS, typography and new technologies coming and going away (saddly) is that the basics are still important. With that in mind I'll look at typography through a series of exercises. The exercises can be edited and will change the display of the associated text; you can then copy and paste the resulting CSS to your own CSS/SCSS stylesheet.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The first thing to learn is that all typefaces are different. What works for the typefaces I chose may or may not work for the typefaces you choose for your projects. Where possible I'll show the typefaces used in this page against other typefaces (most likely from the 'web safe' font set.)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Why worry about typography on the web?</h2>

        <p>Universal Typography -- Tim Brown</p>
      </div>

      <p>I love the web and I've been working on digital content for almost 20 years. While I agree with the universality and accessibility requirements for the web (it should be acessible by anyone anywhere, regardless of disability.) But it doesn't mean that usable has to equal boring or plain</p>

      <p>Whether we are reading a paper book or a web page or a iBook or Kindle ebook, typography still matters and it's still an important part of the design process.</p>

      <p>For the longest time I've heard that the web is not print and that we shouldn't look at books as sources for web design inspiration. This may be true: the web is not print. But we're getting to the point where CSS on its own or a combination of CSS and Javascript will gives a large part of what we see in print in a way that won't look terrible in older browsers, when the user access it with assistive technology, or when CSS and Javascript are disabled.</p>

      <p>I started taking a serious look at typography about 3 years ago. I'm not an expect and I'm most definitely not a professional but I'm learning and the more I learn the more I think we can use the full range of web technologies to enhance the text and the reading experience for our users.</p>

        <h2><a name='font-selection'></a>Font Selection</h2>

        <h3><a name='font-stacks'></a>Font stacks</h3>

        <p>Unless you're using one of the universal fonts, those available everywhere, you will most likely have to plan for what happens if your browser cannot load the font because your internet connection just died or you got caught using a font that you were not licensed to use. That's where you use the font stack.</p>

        <p>At its simplest, the stack is the list of fonts that you want to use in your page going from left to right. For example in the following font stack:</p>

        <pre><code class='css'>html {
  font-family: 'Museo Sans', Verdana, sans-serif;
}</code></pre>

        <p>The browser will use Museo Sans, if is available in a format that the browser can read, if it isn't then the browser will use Verdana and... in the unlikely event that verdana is not available the browser will use the system's default sans serif font.</p>

        <p>Why is this important, you may be asking. Because not all fonts are the same. Even fonts that look very similar may be different enough to cause problems with your layout. Let's look at the same Lorem Ipsum text in two different fonts.

          <p>The first example will use Stone Humanist, the font I chose for the body text in this document.</p>

<div class="css-example">
            <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

div#example1 {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  font-family: 'Stone-Humanist', sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.3;
  margin-top: 1em;
  padding: 1em
}
          </style>

          <div id='example1'>
            <p>Bacon ipsum dolor amet sint t-bone et aliquip proident ex dolor. Landjaeger tail duis, nostrud brisket strip steak shankle turducken. Laborum sausage aliqua, non quis laboris est brisket reprehenderit ball tip cow capicola. Meatloaf commodo jerky adipisicing.</p>
            <p>Ad short ribs adipisicing, lorem beef elit eiusmod laborum pork belly labore. Aliqua jowl id, ut cupim in swine short ribs. Nulla short loin enim drumstick in, minim rump pancetta. Fatback qui corned beef, strip steak spare ribs elit minim pig. Cupidatat aliquip pariatur, pork belly tenderloin flank cillum.</p>
          </div>
</div>
         <p>Example usinng Stone Humanist</p>

          <p>The second example uses <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Verdana">Verdana</a>, a font created for and released by Microsoft in 1996.</p>

<div class="css-example">
            <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

div#example2 {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.3;
  margin-top: 1em;
  padding: 1em;
}
          </style>
          <div id='example2'>
            <p>Bacon ipsum dolor amet sint t-bone et aliquip proident ex dolor. Landjaeger tail duis, nostrud brisket strip steak shankle turducken. Laborum sausage aliqua, non quis laboris est brisket reprehenderit ball tip cow capicola. Meatloaf commodo jerky adipisicing.</p>
            <p>Ad short ribs adipisicing, lorem beef elit eiusmod laborum pork belly labore. Aliqua jowl id, ut cupim in swine short ribs. Nulla short loin enim drumstick in, minim rump pancetta. Fatback qui corned beef, strip steak spare ribs elit minim pig. Cupidatat aliquip pariatur, pork belly tenderloin flank cillum.</p>
          </div>

</div>
                   <p>Example using Verdana</p>

          <p>Notice, in particular, how Verdana's characters are wider and therefore make the line have less content when compared with Stone Humanist. As a further experiment change the front in Example 2-2 from Verdana to Arial and see the difference.</p>

          <h3>&quot;Web Safe&quot; Fonts</h3>

          <p>Ever since browsers started using fonts they;ve been able to use fonts available on the user's system. These are the &quot;web safe&quot; fonts.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.cssfontstack.com/">CSS Font Stack</a> presents a list of some of the most common desktop fonts that are installed in Macintosh and Windows operating systems. As you can see there are a few fonts that are really safe to use across platforms.</p>

          <p>This is yet another consideration when building our font stack. If we build backups other than generic fonts we need to be careful to pick fonts that are wide used or pick 2 or more options to cover both Windows and Macintosh cases.</p>

          <h3>Generic font families</h3>

          <p>Most of the time we have a certain font selected for our project and most of the time they will work ok. But what happens when they don't?</p>

          <p>As we saw in the earlier examples the typeface you choose will affect number of words you can fit in a line of text and the way the font writes on screen may look different with the same line height </p>

          <p>CSS defines a number of generic font families for use with your content. These families are (with defnitions taken from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/">CSS 2.1</a> specification):</p>

          <dl>
            <dt><strong>serif</strong></dt>
            <dd>Glyphs of serif fonts, as the term is used in CSS, tend to have finishing strokes, flared or tapering ends, or have actual serifed (including slab serifs). Serif fonts are typically proportionately-spaced. They often display a greater variation between thick and thin strokes than fonts from the 'sans-serif' generic font family. CSS uses the term 'serif' to apply to a font for any script, although other names may be more familiar for particular scripts, such as Mincho (Japanese), Sung or Song (Chinese), Totum or Kodig (Korean). Any font that is so described may be used to represent the generic 'serif' family.</dd>

            <dt><strong>sans-serif</strong></dt>
            <dd>Glyphs in sans-serif fonts, as the term is used in CSS, tend to have stroke endings that are plain -- with little or no flaring, cross stroke, or other ornamentation. Sans-serif fonts are typically proportionately-spaced. They often have little variation between thick and thin strokes, compared to fonts from the 'serif' family. CSS uses the term 'sans-serif' to apply to a font for any script, although other names may be more familiar for particular scripts, such as Gothic (Japanese), Kai (Chinese), or Pathang (Korean). Any font that is so described may be used to represent the generic 'sans-serif' family.</dd>

            <dt><strong>cursive</strong></dt>
            <dd>Glyphs in cursive fonts, as the term is used in CSS, generally have either joining strokes or other cursive characteristics beyond those of italic typefaces. The glyphs are partially or completely connected, and the result looks more like handwritten pen or brush writing than printed letterwork. Fonts for some scripts, such as Arabic, are almost always cursive. CSS uses the term 'cursive' to apply to a font for any script, although other names such as Chancery, Brush, Swing and Script are also used in font names.</dd>

            <dt><strong>fantasy</strong></dt>
            <dd>Fantasy fonts, as used in CSS, are primarily decorative while still containing representations of characters (as opposed to Pi or Picture fonts, which do not represent characters).</dd>

            <dt><strong>monospace</strong></dt>
            <dd>The sole criterion of a monospace font is that all glyphs have the same fixed width. (This can make some scripts, such as Arabic, look most peculiar.) The effect is similar to a manual typewriter, and is often used to set samples of computer code.</dd>
          </dl>

          <p>Using a generic family as the last item in your font stack is essential. The system is guaranteed to be available and you can style your content with this in mind. It also makes your CSS less succeptuble to slow connections or network failures.</p>

          <h3><a name='considerations'></a>Additional Considerations</h3>

          <p>There are a couple more elements to consider when selecting a font. They may not seem as important but when put together with evcerything else we'll discuss in this page, it's a lot more important than we give it credit for.</p>

          <h4><a name='size'></a>Font size</h4>

          <p>Even when working with Desktop Operating Systems alone a font may look very different. It doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the design and all with how the operating system renders fonts and it may not even happen but this is something to consider when testing.</p>

          <p>Smaller sizes may cause font details to dissapear as the font grows smaller. This may affect the typeface you use for your body text, particularly in smaller devices.</p>

          <p>Fonts have become more interesting when  particularly since Apple released 'Retina' iPhones and iPads and Android phones have been released with even higher pixel density. While the higher density allows you to use more typefaces, your design must still consider browsers with lower pixel density in your design.</p>

            <img src="images/font-in-chrome-mac.png">
            <figcaption>This page displayed during development in Chrome for OSX</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure>
            <img src="images/font-in-spartan-win-vm.png">
            <figcaption>Content displayed in Microsoft Edge running in a Windows 10 virtual machine</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h4><a name='line-height'></a>Line height</h4>

          <p>In CSS line-height control the vertical space between lines. It can help readability and make it easier for people with dissabilities to engage with your content. </p>

          <pre><code class='css'>p {
  font: 1em/1.5 arial, helvetica, sans-serif;
}</code></pre>

          <p>Which is equivalent to this, much more verbose, syntax:</p>

          <pre><code class='css'>p {
  font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1em;
  line-height: 1.5;
}</code></pre>

          <p>I personally prefer the second syntax. It's explicit in telling you what each attribute controls and it saves you from having to remember what does each part of the expression means. That said you're more than welcome to use either syntax.</p>

          <p>So why do we care about line height. In the example below change the line height attribute, play with values from 1 to 2 or even 3 and see the difference. Which one is more comfortable to read?</p>

<div class="css-example">
            <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

div#example3 {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif;
  font-size: 1em;
  line-height: 1.3;
  padding: 1em;
}
          </style>

          <div id='example3'>
            <p>Bacon ipsum dolor amet sint t-bone et aliquip proident ex dolor. Landjaeger tail duis, nostrud brisket strip steak shankle turducken. Laborum sausage aliqua, non quis laboris est brisket reprehenderit ball tip cow capicola. Meatloaf commodo jerky adipisicing.</p>
            <p>Ad short ribs adipisicing, lorem beef elit eiusmod laborum pork belly labore. Aliqua jowl id, ut cupim in swine short ribs. Nulla short loin enim drumstick in, minim rump pancetta. Fatback qui corned beef, strip steak spare ribs elit minim pig. Cupidatat aliquip pariatur, pork belly tenderloin flank cillum.</p>
          </div>
</div>
          <p>Example demonstrating what happens when you change line-height</p>

          <h3><a name='line-width'></a>Line width</h3>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Anything from 45 to 75 characters is widely regarded as a satisfactory length of line for a single-column page set in a serifed text face in a text size. The 66-character line (counting both letters and spaces) is widely regarded as ideal. For multiple-column work, a better average is 40 to 50 characters.</p>
            <p>Robert Bringhurst’s The Elements of Typographic Style, (p.26)</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Until I started working with web type I had never considered line length as an element when building content. But it makes sense, the longer a line of text is the more we need to be mindful when working with it. In the example below, the text at the same width looks significantly different when we adjust the line height.</p>

<div class="css-example">
            <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

div#widthExample1 {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif;
  font-size: 1em;
  padding: 1em;
}

div#widthExample1 p.p1 {
  width: 80%;
  line-height: 1.3;
}

div#widthExample1 p.p2 {
  width: 80%;
  line-height: 1.5;
}

div#widthExample1 p.p3 {
  width: 120%;
  line-height: 1.3;
}

div#widthExample1 p.p4 {
  width: 120%;
  line-height: 1.5;
}

</style>

          <div id='widthExample1'>

          <p>What happens when you change line-height for text of a given width</p>

          <h3><a name='so-what'></a>So what should the stack look like?</h3>

          <p>So, after all these conversations about different types of typefaces, fonts, availability and when to use and not to use them, what should a good font stack look like?</p>

          <p>As with many thing in the web it depends. If you were given fonts as part of your design brief then you should follup up with the designer regarding fall back fonts.</p>

          <p>If this is your design then I'd suggest sites like <a href="http://fontsinuse.com/">Fonts in use</a> or <a href="http://www.typewolf.com/">Typewolf</a> to see how other people are using fonts. Another way is to identify a font you like (like I did with the body font for this page), research whether it's available as a web font and how much would it cost to license.</p>

        <p>Once you know what font you want to use, there are services like <a href="http://typecast.com/">Typecast</a> to see what the font will look like in an actuall web page... you can even add chunks of your own content to get a more acurate picture of what the typeface will look like with <em>your</em> content.</p>

        <p>My default font stack for this project looks like this:</p>

        <pre><code class="css">html {
  font-family: 'Stone-Humanist', arial, sans-serif;
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>I use a different stack for headings and this will be discussed when we talk about <a href="#headings">headings</a> in more detail.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2><a name='loading'></a>Loading Fonts</h2>

        <p>Now that we have a better idea of what fonts we want to use and the font stack we'll see how to load them into the page. We'll explore 3 ways: local loading using the <em>@font-face syntax</em>, loading fonts using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started">Google font API</a> and using Google's <a href="https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader/blob/master/README.md">Web Font Loader</a></p>

        <h3><a name='at-font-face'></a>@font-face </h3>

        <p>We have been able to use fonts on our web content since the days of IE 3 (3.5 for Macintosh if I remember correctly) but we've always had to contend with font creators and foundries fear of piracy. It's only recently that they have relented and allowed their fonts to be used. The basic syntax, covering all modern browsers, looks like this:</p>


        <pre><code class="css">@font-face {
    font-family: 'stone-sans-webfont';
    src: url('../path-to-font-file.eot');
    src: url('../path-to-font-file.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
         url('../path-to-font-file.woff2') format('woff2'),
         url('../path-to-font-file.woff') format('woff'),
         url('../path-to-font-file.ttf') format('truetype'),
         url('../path-to-font-file.svg#stone-sans-webfont') format('svg');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
}</code></pre>

        <p>And then we associate the font with CSS like we normally would matching the font-family attribute in the @font-face declaration with the font-family attribute of the element where we want to use it:</p>

        <pre><code class="css">html {
        font-family: 'stone-sans-webfont', arial, sans-serif;
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>Since we want to avoid faux bold and faux italics in our content, we add the bold and italics versions of our font to the page and then match them to the correct attributes with selectors similar to this:</p>

        <pre><code class="css">strong {
  font-family: 'Stone-Humanist-Semi';
}

em {
  font-family: 'Stone-Humanist-Ita';
}

/*
  When using both we don't care what order they are used in
*/
strong em,
em strong {
  font-family: 'Stone-Humanist-SemiItalic';
}
</code></pre>

        <p>Where <em>Stone-Humanist-Semi</em> is our (semi)bold font, <em>Stone-Humanist-Ita</em> is italics and <em>Stone-Humanist-SemiItalic</em> is the semibold italics combination. Since <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> have different semantic meaning in HTML5 I've chosen not to style them.</p>

        <h4>Some things to keep in mind</h4>

        <p>Adding the font to your site/book/app adds to the overall file size. Depending on the font this may increase the size of your project considerably. Taking <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=gentium">Gentium</a> as an example, the font supports Latin, Greek and Cyrillic character sets but it weighs a hefty 500k for the regular font (in one format out of the 5 formats needed to support multiple browsers/devices). Add Bold, Italic and you get 1.5 Megabytes just for the font! And it may not be the only font you use in the project. </p>

        <p>The flipside to this issue of size is that embedding the fonts means they are always available to desktop and mobile browsers readers that support embedding (and it should be all of them.) Choosing what browsers and what versions to support is a different story.</p>

        <h3><a name='google-font-api'></a>Google Fonts API</h3>

        <p>Google has two ways of using web fonts, the first one is directly through their API. Using Google's font API is a two step process. First add the font to your html head element with the following syntax (using Tangerine as an example):</p>

        <pre><code class="html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Tangerine"></code></pre>

        <p>The link produces a CSS @font-face declaration that we can use in our CSS as normal. The version produced in Chrome and Firefox uses the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF2/">woff2</a> format</p>

        <pre><code class="css">@font-face {
  font-family: 'Tangerine';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Tangerine'), url(http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/tangerine/v6/HGfsyCL5WASpHOFnouG-RJBw1xU1rKptJj_0jans920.woff2) format('woff2');
  unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02C6, U+02DA, U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2212, U+2215, U+E0FF, U+EFFD, U+F000;
}</code></pre>

        <p>While Safari uses True Type to render the font.</p>

        <pre><code class="css">@font-face {
  font-family: 'Tangerine';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Tangerine'), url(http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/tangerine/v6/HGfsyCL5WASpHOFnouG-RCZ2oysoEQEeKwjgmXLRnTc.ttf) format('truetype');
}</code></pre>

        <p>As you can see the advantage of using the APi is that we don't need to use multiple formats in our @font-face declaration. Google takes care of that for us.</p>

        <p>The obvoius disadvantage is that this only works online. That's why a fallback option or options is even more important when working with the API. If we're offline or connectivity is limited we want a good fallback font.</p>

        <h3><a name='googe-web-font-loader'></a>Google web font loader</h3>

        <p>One of the things neither the font API or directly downloading the content doesn't address is the "flash of unstyled text." According to the <a href="http://help.typekit.com/customer/portal/articles/6852-Controlling-the-Flash-of-Unstyled-Text-or-FOUT-using-Font-Events">Typekit Help Center</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Fonts are loaded as assets into a web page—just like images or video. Depending on your browser or your connection speed, they can load quickly or lag behind the rest of the page. Different browsers handle font loading differently; for example, Safari and Chrome will refrain from displaying text set in a web font until the font has loaded, while Internet Explorer won’t show anything on the page until the font loads. Meanwhile, Firefox will display the site with the fallback fonts in the font stack, and then switch to the linked fonts after they’ve finished loading. This results in a flash of unstyled text, or FOUT.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Typekit, in collaboration with Google, has created loader library to make working with type easier. It works by adding scripts to the page that load the library and tell it what fonts to download and use. For example to load the Droid Sans font from Google you'd use code like this:</p>

        <pre><code class="html">&lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1.5.10/webfont.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script>
  WebFont.load({
    typekit: {
      id: 'xxxxxx'
    },
    custom: {
      families: ['Droid Sans', 'Source Code Pro'],
    },
    google: {
      families: ['Droid Sans', 'Droid Serif'],
      text: 'abcdedfghijklmopqrstuvwxyz!'
    },
    fontdeck: {
      id: 'xxxxx'
    },
    monotype: {
      projectId: 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx',
      version: 12345 // (optional, flushes the CDN cache)
    }
  });
&lt;/script></code></pre>

     <p>Or using asynchronous loading:</p>

     <pre><code class='javascript'>&lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1.5.10/webfont.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script>
  WebFontConfig = {
    google: { families: [ 'Lora:400,700,400italic,700italic:latin' ] }
  };
  (function() {
    var wf = document.createElement('script');
    wf.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https' : 'http') +
      '://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1/webfont.js';
    wf.type = 'text/javascript';
    wf.async = 'true';
    var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(wf, s);
  })();

&lt;noscript>
  &lt;link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lora:400,700,400italic,700italic' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
&lt;/noscript></code></pre>
      <p>For an explanation of the values for each foundry check the Font Loader's <a href="https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader/blob/master/README.md">readme file</a> in Github.</p>

      <p>The font loader creates a set of events, both CSS and Javascript, for developers to interact with. This is similar to the way Modernizr handles feature detection. The Javascript classes are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>loading - This event is triggered when all fonts have been requested.</li>
        <li>active - This event is triggered when the fonts have rendered.</li>
        <li>inactive - This event is triggered when the browser does not support linked fonts or if none of the fonts could be loaded.</li>
        <li>fontloading - This event is triggered once for each font that's loaded.</li>
        <li>fontactive - This event is triggered once for each font that renders.</li>
        <li>fontinactive - This event is triggered if the font can't be loaded.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>CSS events are implemented as classes on the html element. The following classes are set on the html element and correspond to the descriptions above:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>.wf-loading</li>
          <li>.wf-active</li>
          <li>.wf-inactive</li>
          <li>.wf-&lt;familyname>-&lt;fvd>-loading</li>
          <li>.wf-&lt;familyname>-&lt;fvd>-active</li>
          <li>.wf-&lt;familyname>-&lt;fvd>-inactive</li>
        </ul>

     <p>The &lt;familyname> placeholder will be replaced by a sanitized version of the name of each font family in lowercase with only alphanumeric characters. For example, Droid Sans becomes droidsans. The &lt;fvd> placeholder is a <a href="http://typekit.github.io/fvd/">Font Variation Description,</a> a shorthand for describing the style and weight of a particular font.</p>


     <h4>So why would we use the Font Loader?</h4>

     <p>In short: to make the user's experience less jarring. Since fonts are downloaded as any other resource in your web page. If we use the following font stack: <code>'stone-sans-webfont', arial, sans-serif</code>, we can then use the Font Loader Defined classes to make the transition to our fonts smoother and better looking. Let's look at one possibility:</p>

     <pre><code class="css">.wf-inactive body{
  font-family: arial, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.4em;
}

.wf-active body {
  font-family: 'stone-sans-webfont', arial, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.3
}
     </code></pre>

     <p><code>.wf-inactive</code> indicates that loading the font or fonts (in this case we are using one) has not started. To make sure that the user doesn't see a system fault we provide a fallback option while the web font(s) are loading. This may be an instant or maybe several seconds in a slow or congested network connection (try Starbucks on a Sunday afternoon.)</p>

     <p>Once the font(s) load, the class will switch to <code>.wf-active</code> where we put out web font stack and attributes related to font. In this case I only added a different line-height attribute to the selector but you can be as detailed as you want.</p>

     <p>One last detail: <strong>What happens if Javascript is disabled?</strong></p>

     <p>If you're fonts are loaded from google you can revert back to useing the Google API to load your fonts. You can do something like:</p>

     <pre><code class="html">&lt;noscript>
  &lt;link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:700italic,300,700,300italic' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
&lt;/noscript></code></pre>

     <h3><a name='font-face-observer'></a>Font Face Observer</h3>

     <p>As good as the Webfont Loader is good it causes some Flash of Invisible text when the fonts load and the browser switches from the system fonts to the webfonts it just loaded. The script for the Webfont Loader must be placed in the <code>head</code> of the document with all the performance pitfalls inherent to it.</p>

     <p>Font Face Observer, a fairly new delivery mechanism developed by Adobe Typekit engineer Bram Stein, uses JavaScript’s scroll events to load and monitor web fonts. Unlike the Web Font Loader, the Font Face Observer can be referenced at the end of document to avoid the extra overhead. Scott Jehl's approach, as documented in the <a href='http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/font-events.html'>Filament's Group blog</a> and is the system we'll discuss below. The full page is shown below and will be explained as we go along.</p>

     <pre><code class='html'>&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;!--#if expr="$HTTP_COOKIE=/fonts\-loaded\=true/" -->
&lt;html lang="en" class="fonts-loaded">
&lt;!--#else -->
&lt;html lang="en">
&lt;!--#endif -->
&lt;head>
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8">
  &lt;title>&lt;/title>
  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  &lt;style>
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'Lora';
      src: url('lora-regular.woff2') format('woff2'),
           url('lora-regular.woff') format('woff'),
           url('lora-regular.ttf') format('truetype');
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
  }
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'Lora';
      src: url('lora-italic.woff2') format('woff2'),
           url('lora-italic.woff') format('woff'),
           url('lora-italic.ttf') format('truetype');
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: italic;
    }
    body {
        font-family: serif;
  }
    .fonts-loaded body {
        font-family: Lora, serif;
  }
&lt;/style>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
    &lt;p>&lt;!-- paragraph text -->&lt;/p>
    &lt;script src="fontfaceobserver.js">&lt;/script>
    &lt;script>
    (function( w ){
    if( w.document.documentElement.className.indexOf( "fonts-loaded" ) > -1 ){
        return;
    }
    var font1 = new w.FontFaceObserver( "Lora", {
        weight: 400
    });
    var font2 = new w.FontFaceObserver( "Lora", {
        weight: 400,
        style: "italic"
    });
    w.Promise
        .all([font1.check(), font2.check()])
        .then(function(){
            w.document.documentElement.className += " fonts-loaded";
        });
    }( this ));
    &lt;/script>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html></code></pre>

    <p>The first thing we do is to use Server Side Includes, a way to have the server generate pieces of content for the web, to add the <code>fonts-loaded</code> CSS class if the corresponding cookie has already been set. In this way the loader will only use the fonts if they've been already been loaded, otherwise it will not add the class and the process will continue.<p>

    <pre><code class='html'>&lt;!--#if expr="$HTTP_COOKIE=/fonts\-loaded\=true/" -->
&lt;html lang="en" class="fonts-loaded">
&lt;!--#else -->
&lt;html lang="en"></code></pre>

   <p>While still in the head of the document we load our fonts using the @font-face syntax we discussed earlier and associate the fonts with the css needed. Note that we have two classes for the body, a plain one where only system fonts are used and a version with the fonts-loaded class where the webfont is the primary and the system font is our backup. </p>

   <pre><code class='html'>  &lt;style>
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'Lora';
      src: url('lora-regular.woff2') format('woff2'),
           url('lora-regular.woff') format('woff'),
           url('lora-regular.ttf') format('truetype');
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
  }
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'Lora';
      src: url('lora-italic.woff2') format('woff2'),
           url('lora-italic.woff') format('woff'),
           url('lora-italic.ttf') format('truetype');
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: italic;
    }
    body {
        font-family: serif;
  }
    .fonts-loaded body {
        font-family: Lora, serif;
  }
&lt;/style></code></pre>

   <p>At the bottom of our pages, along with all the other scripts, we add a link to the fontfaceobserver library. The second script begins with a conditional check to see if the <code>class-loaded</code> class hs been added to the root element (html); if it has been then quit, there is nothing left to do.</p>

   <p>We next define variables for each of the fonts we will use in our document. This will be used in the last part of the script, discussed below.</p>

    <pre><code class='html'>    &lt;script src="fontfaceobserver.js">&lt;/script>
    &lt;script>
    (function( w ){
    if( w.document.documentElement.className.indexOf( "fonts-loaded" ) > -1 ){
        return;
    }
    var font1 = new w.FontFaceObserver( "Lora", {
        weight: 400
    });
    var font2 = new w.FontFaceObserver( "Lora", {
        weight: 400,
        style: "italic"
    });
    </code></pre>

    <p>The last part of the script uses a <a href='http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/'>promise</a>. Once both promises fulfill it will add the <code>fonts-loaded</code> class to the document (root) element, in this case, html. </p>

    <pre><code class='html'>
    w.Promise
        .all([font1.check(), font2.check()])
        .then(function(){
            w.document.documentElement.className += " fonts-loaded";
        });
    }( this ));
    &lt;/script></code></pre>

    <p>The next result is that the fonts will be loaded asynchronously and that the system font assigned to an element will only change after the font has loaded. This prevents flashes of unstyled content and flashes of invisible content. But in the end which font loading strategy you use is up to you.</p>

        <h2><a name='paragraph-styling'></a>Paragraph styling</h2>

        <p>Most the time we spend engaged with text is with paragraphs and that's where I put a lot of my research time when working on a new project. You may be asking why put so much work on how the paragraphs look... As you will see in the example below there are many elements that are involved in controlling paragraph appearance.</p>

<div class="css-example">
    <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

div#example4 {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  padding: 1em;
  width: 100%;
}

div#example4 p:first-child {
  text-indent: 0;
  font-size: 1em;
}
div#example4 p {
  font-family: 'Stone-Humanist', arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1em; /* 1em = 16px */
  line-height: 1.3;
  text-align: left;
  text-indent: 2em;
  letter-spacing: 0;
  word-spacing: 0;

}
          </style>

          <div id='example4'>

                   <p>Playing with paragraph type</p>

                    <p>With the content above we can now start playing with type. Do the following activities to get a feel for how much type can change:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Change the font-size on <code>div#example4 p:first-child</code> to 1.5em</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Does the size of the first paragraph change your reaction to it? Does size matter?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Remove the reference to "Stone Humanist" to see what would the text look like in Arial</li>
            <li>Remove the reference to Arial to see what the text would look like in the system's Sans Serif font</li>
            <ul>
              <li>What are the differences between the three fonts?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Change the font-size attribute to 1.5em and the line-height to 1 Is it harder to read?</li>
            <li>Change the line-height to 1.5. Does it get easier?</li>
            <li>Chang the reference to "Stone Humanist" to Verdana. Can you describe the changes?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Does the line height change how easy or hard it is to read the text?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Change the width attribute of <code>div#example4</code> to 50%</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Does the text become harder to read as it gets narrower?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Change the word spacing from normal to .25em</li>
            <li>Change the word spacing from .25em to -.25em</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Does the text become harder to read as it gets sspread further apart? As it gets condensed together?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Change the letter spacing from 0 to .25em.</li>
            <li>Change the letter spacing from .25em to -.25em</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Does the text become harder to read as it gets sspread further apart? As it gets condensed together?</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>

          <p>The typeface you select does make a difference. While we may not conciously notice how the text changes the changes affect the way text looks and the way we interact with it. I know I hit you with a lot of activities and questions for this little paragraph exercise so feel free to play with some, all or none of the activities above. </p>

          <p>But whether you use them or not, you get the idea of how much work goes into making paragraphs read well.</p>

          <h3><a name='dropcaps'></a>Drop caps</h3>

          <p>Most (if not all) of us have seen the big initial capital letter on the first paragraph of a chapter. We can do th is with CSS. One version of the effect looks like the code below using first--of-type and first-letter to identify the first letter of the first paragraph and the styles to apply to t his pseudo element</p>

          <pre><code class="css">p:first-of-type:first-letter {

  line-height: 0.9em;
  float: left;
  padding-right: 0.15em;

          </code></pre>

    <p>Example of drop cap using pseudo classes</p>

    <p>Unfortunately older browsers don't support the :first-of-type selector (looking at IE7 and possibly IE8) so we have to work around and tie the drop cap to the first element. Most of the time this will be an h1 or other heading element but it can be any element you want. If you don't care about supporting older browsers then this is a non-issue but coding defensively is always a good practice :)</p>

        <h2><a name="headings"></a>Headings</h2>

        <p>Headings serve as the visual representation of our content and, as such, they deserve special consideration. We'll discuss whether to use the same font as our body or whether it's better to use a different one, and some things we can do with heading text. I wish I could tell you exactly what fonts to use but, as with many things type related, it'll depend on many factors.</p>

        <p>Let's look at what the possibilities are. </p>

        <h3><a name='same-or-different'></a>Same or different fontface?</h3>

        <p>One of the questions that always baffles me is whether to use the same font for headings as I use for the body text. </p>


<div class="css-example">
    <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

div#headingFontExample1 {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  padding: 1em;
  width: 100%;
}


div#headingFontExample1 h1 {
  font-family: 'Stone-Humanist', sans-serif;
}

div#headingFontExample1 h1 + p:first-letter {
  font-size: 1em;
}
  </style>

      <div id='headingFontExample1'>
        <h1>This is the bacon 22</h1>
        <p>Bacon ipsum dolor amet sint t-bone et aliquip proident ex dolor. Landjaeger tail duis, nostrud brisket strip steak shankle turducken. Laborum sausage aliqua, non quis laboris est brisket reprehenderit ball tip cow capicola. Meatloaf commodo jerky adipisicing. Ad short ribs adipisicing, lorem beef elit eiusmod laborum pork belly labore. Aliqua jowl id, ut cupim in swine short ribs. Nulla short loin enim drumstick in, minim rump pancetta. Fatback qui corned beef, strip steak spare ribs elit minim pig. Cupidatat aliquip pariatur, pork belly tenderloin flank cillum.</p>
      </div>
</div>
<p>Heading using body type</p>

<p>The second example uses a Serif font, Roboto Slab, in the headings with Stone Humanist as the body font. I like the contrast better but am not 100% sold on the idea, so let's try one more variant.</p>

<div class="css-example">
    <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

div#headingFontExample2 {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  padding: 1em;
  width: 100%;
}

div#headingFontExample2 h1 {
  font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;
}

div#headingFontExample2 h1 + p:first-letter {
  font-size: 1em;
}
  </style>

      <div id='headingFontExample2'>
        <h1>This is the bacon</h1>
        <p>Bacon ipsum dolor amet sint t-bone et aliquip proident ex dolor. Landjaeger tail duis, nostrud brisket strip steak shankle turducken. Laborum sausage aliqua, non quis laboris est brisket reprehenderit ball tip cow capicola. Meatloaf commodo jerky adipisicing. Ad short ribs adipisicing, lorem beef elit eiusmod laborum pork belly labore. Aliqua jowl id, ut cupim in swine short ribs. Nulla short loin enim drumstick in, minim rump pancetta. Fatback qui corned beef, strip steak spare ribs elit minim pig. Cupidatat aliquip pariatur, pork belly tenderloin flank cillum.</p>
      </div>
</div>
<p>Heading using a serif web font</p>

<p>The last option is to use a typeface from the web safe palette. One of my favorite typefaces is Verdana so we'll try that for headings and see how that looks on our headins with the font selected for the body. And here it is:</p>

<div class="css-example">
    <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

div#headingFontExample3 {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  padding: 1em;
  width: 100%;
}

div#headingFontExample3 h1 {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

div#headingFontExample3 h1 + p:first-letter {
  font-size: 1em;
}
  </style>

      <div id='headingFontExample3'>
        <h1>This is the bacon</h1>
        <p>Bacon ipsum dolor amet sint t-bone et aliquip proident ex dolor. Landjaeger tail duis, nostrud brisket strip steak shankle turducken. Laborum sausage aliqua, non quis laboris est brisket reprehenderit ball tip cow capicola. Meatloaf commodo jerky adipisicing. Ad short ribs adipisicing, lorem beef elit eiusmod laborum pork belly labore. Aliqua jowl id, ut cupim in swine short ribs. Nulla short loin enim drumstick in, minim rump pancetta. Fatback qui corned beef, strip steak spare ribs elit minim pig. Cupidatat aliquip pariatur, pork belly tenderloin flank cillum.</p>
      </div>
</div>
  <p>Heading using a system's serif font</p>

  <p>So with these three options which one should I pick? Three typefaces may not be enough but out of the three I'd pick Roboto Slab. We should certainly test additional fonts either with a system like the one I just did or with <a href="http://typecast.com/">Typecast</a> but I was narrowing the choice to these three so doing it by hand was less of a hassle than setting up Typecast. In a larger project I would set up Typecast earlier and do all the testing there. </p>

<h3><a name='playing-with-heading-type'></a>Playing with heading type</h3>

  <p>Now that we've selected the font we can look at some effects that will make the headings stand out further. We can play with changing the capitalization of the heading, make them all upper or lower case and maybe even change letter and word spacing.</p>

  <p>The example below uses different values for the text-transform property to change the way the headings look.</p>

<div class="css-example">
    <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

div#headingExample {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  padding: 1em;
  width: 100%;
}

#headingExample h2 {
  text-transform: capitalize;
}

#headingExample strong {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

#headingExample .uc {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

#headingExample .lc {
  text-transform: lowercase;
}

#headingExample .narrow {
  letter-spacing: -.125em;
}

#headingExample .wide {
  letter-spacing: .125em;
          </style>

          <div id='headingExample'>

      <p>Different text effects applied to headings</p>

      </section>

     <section>
             <h2><a name='color'></a>Color</h2>

      <p>Another aspect to consider is the color for your typefaces. This is a very design-dependent step. Were you given a color palette as part of your design brief? Then use those. But if you're planning your own project then you can use the tools below.</p>

      <p><a href="https://color.adobe.com/">Adobe Color CSS</a> (Formerly known as Adobe Kuler) let's you create color sets for your projects. If you use SASS/SCSS you can then turn the colors into variables to use in your CSS.</p>

      <p>Dudley Storye creataed a <a href="http://demosthenes.info/blog/927/The-New-Defaults-A-Sass-Color-Thesaurus">color Thesaurus</a> that makes it easier to see what the colors will look like in the page. We can combine the colors from the chart with text to test </p>

       <p>For this section I've created an <a href="https://color.adobe.com/Labs-Color-Scheme-1-color-theme-3359413/">Adobe Color CC Palette</a>.</p>

       <p>It may not have al the colors I need and I'm in no way required to use all the colors in the palette but I will set them up anyways so we can see what it looks like in all the colors available to the palette.</p>

    <p>We can also test color with our paragraph formatting. I will pick the second color palette for this experiment. Notice how the lighter colors make things harder to read and the darker colors help... When we discuss accessibility concerns we'll touch on color blindness and contrast as necessary elements of your typographical design.</p>

    <p>Even different shades of gray/grey may have an impact. In the last color example I've picked different shades of grey for each paragraph color. As with many things related to type, the best color for your text will depend on the typeface you choose.</p>

      <p>How different shades of gray/grey look as text color</p>     </section>

     <section>
        <h2><a name='media-queries'></a>Media Queries: Not all displays are equal</h2>

        <p>Media queries are a part of the progressive enhancement process. Using Media Queries (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">Specification</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/">first public draft of Level 4 extensions</a>) you can use a single CSS style sheet to work with multiple devices.</p>

        <p>At its most basic, a media query tells the browser to change selectors and attributes based on a certain value or to load (or not load) a specified resource. For example, you can use media queries when loading a stylesheet with a link element:</p>

        <pre><code class='css'><!-- CSS media query on a link element -->
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="(max-width: 800px)" href="example.css" /></code></pre>

        <p>In this query, The user agen test is the the user agent is 800 pixels wider or narrower and, if it is, it will load the specified style sheet; otherwise it'll skip it.</p>

        <p>You can also use media queries inside a stylesheet (internal or external) using the media at-rule. </p>

        <pre><code class='css'><!-- CSS media query within a stylesheet -->
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .facet_sidebar {
    display: none;
  }
}
</code></pre>

       <p>In the stylesheet example, the test if for width of 600 pixels or less. If the rule is matches then we will change the display propery of the facet_siderbar class to hide it. You can have multiple rules inside each media query.</p>

       <p>You can also do multiple queries, limit them to specific device types (like screen or print) and even chain queries together. The following example taken from <a href='https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/'>CSS Tricks.com</a> provides media queries for some iPhones (the article has additional queries for standard devices.)</p>

        <pre><code class='css'><!-- CSS media query within a stylesheet -->

        <p>This begs a question: <strong>Do we design for devices or resolutions?</strong></p>

        <p>Justin Avery suggests that <a href=''>we don't need device specific media queries</a> and that we should base the media queries we use in the devices and resolutions that we need to support rather than specific devices. He mentions that:</p>

        <blockquote cite='http://responsivedesign.is/articles/why-you-dont-need-device-specific-breakpoints'>
          <p>Over the 4 years we have slowly moved away from device specific breakpoints in favour of content specific breakpoints, i.e. adding a breakpoint when the content is no longer easy to consume.</p>
          <p>With this fundamental shift in thinking we no longer have to fear a new device — a new iPhone width — because we've already fixed our sites to work everywhere.</p>
          <p>-- Justin Avery</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Making changes for print</h3>

        <p>One of the best uses I've seen for media queries is to handle priting web content. As I wrote in <a href='http://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/creating-print-css-stylesheets/'>Creating print CSS stylesheets</a> this is not an alternative to CSS Paged Media but a stop gap to get the online content printed.</p>

        <p>What this media query will do is set up the margins (top, left and right to 1 inch and bottom to 1.5), set the line height to 1.5 (18pt in this case), remove any background image and make the text color black.</p>

        <p>It will then adjust the size of the h1, h2 and h3 elements and hide video, audio, and object elements. These are normally multimedia elements that may or may not be needed in a printed document. If you don't hide them then the printer will spend large amounts of toner or ink to get your content printed (waste of time in my opinion.)</p>

        <pre><code class='css'>/* example changes for printing a web page */
@media print {
  body {
    margin: 1in 1in 1.5in;
    font-size: 12pt;
    line-height: 1.5;
    background-image: none;
    color: #000;
  }

  h1 {
    font-size: 2em;
  }

  h2 {
    font-size: 1.75em;
  }

  h3 {
    font-size: 1.5em;
  }

  video, audio, object {
    display: none
  }
}        </code></pre>

        <h3>Moving forward</h3>

        <p>While the current Media Query specification defines a large set of <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/#media1'>media features</a> to use in our queries, what really excite me are some of the queries (additional <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#mf-dimensions'>dimensions</a>, <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#mf-display-quality'>display quality</a> and <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#mf-interaction'>interaction</a> in particular) available in the editor draft for level 4</p>

        <p>When these queries are supported in browsers we will be able to query for both screen size and DPI density and serve the appropriate content using CSS. It may look something like this:</p>

        <pre><code class='css'>/* possible test for screen size and 2x HDPI */
@media screen and ((min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1024px)) and (resolution &gt;= 2dppx) {
  .facet_sidebar {
    /* Do something for browsers that go between the two values */
  }
}
</code></pre>

        <p>Just in case you're curious (as I was): dppx represents the number of dots per px unit. Due to the 1:96 fixed ratio of CSS in to CSS px, 1dppx is equivalent to 96dpi, that corresponds to the default resolution of images displayed in CSS as defined by image-resolution (from <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/resolution'>MDN</a>.)</p>

        <p>Even when widely supported you <strong>must</strong> test this in your target devices!</p>

      <p>Text Alignment Possibilities</p>

      <p>None of the paragraphs above is hyphenated. Note in particular how the Justified paragraph leaves larger gaps between words to acomodate the justification. It is the same, although not so noticeable, in the other paragraphs.</p>

      <p>Although CSS support hyphenation using the hyphens rule the support is inconsistent (it only works in Firefox. A good alternative is to use libraries such as <a href="http://mnater.github.io/Hyphenator/">hyphenator</a> to provide a consistent hyphenation experience.</p>

      <p>Some of the Hyphenator's drawbacks (also from <a href="http://mnater.github.io/Hyphenator/">http://mnater.github.io/Hyphenator/</a>):</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Hyphenator.js and the hyphenation patterns are quite large. A good compression and caching is vital.</li>
        <li>Automatic hyphenation can not be perfect: it may lead to misleading hyphenation like leg-ends (depends on the pattern quality)</li>
        <li>There's no support for special (aka non-standard) hyphenation (e.g. omaatje->oma-tje)</li>
        <li>There's no way for Javascript to influence the algorithm for laying out text in the browser. Thus we can't control how many hyphens occur on subsequent lines nor can we know which words have actually to be hyphenated. Hyphenator.js just hyphenates all of them.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Automatic kerning Example</p>

       <p>There may situations where you want a less uniform kerning based on specific attributes. We can control the kerning between letters, as in example 8-2, below. The first paragraph has normal kerning; the second paragraph has letters spaced 0.25em; and the third one has a negative kerning of 0.25em.</p>

      <p>kerning Example using word-spacing</p>

      <p>As with many other things in the web, different browsers have different levels of support for kerning. This makes the feature another prime candidate for Autoprefixer. If you're not inclined to automate, you can do something like this:</p>

      <pre><code class="css">div#kerningExample {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  padding: 1em;
  width: 100%;
  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
  -moz-font-feature-settings: "kern";
  -moz-font-feature-settings: "kern=1";
  -ms-font-feature-settings: "kern";
  -o-font-feature-settings: "kern";
  -webkit-font-feature-settings: "kern";
  font-feature-settings: "kern";
}</code></pre>

      <p>There are multiple entries for Firefox (indicated as -moz-font-feature-settings) indicating that the format for the feature changed in an incompatible way.</p>

      <p>The version for Opera (-o-font-feature-settings) is for older versions before adoptin Blink.</p>

       <h3><a name='using-lettering.js'></a>Using Lettering.js</h3>

       <p>One of the biggest drawbacks of using CSS Kerning is that it only work with all letters and all words in a document. If you want to work at a finer level you have to work with libraries like <a href="http://letteringjs.com/">Lettering.js</a>.</p>

       <p>Lettering.js is a jQuery plugin that will automatically add tags (span) and class names to letters, words or lines depending on how we call the plugin. We can then style each individual class as we see fit.</p>

       <p>You can wrap spans around characters, words, lines and combination of the three to get as tight a control over the text style as you need or want. Because it insert classes, designers must be careful to use it in headings or small chunks of text or it will affect performance.</p>

       <p>Working with Lettering.js is a three step process.</p>

       <p>Following the <a href='https://github.com/davatron5000/Lettering.js/wiki/Wrapping-letters-with-lettering()'>Lettering.js Wiki Example</a> we will use this as our example text:</p>

       <pre><code class="html">&lt;h1 class="fancy_title">Some Title&lt;/h1></code></pre>

       <p>First, we need to load and initialize the plugin as you would any other plugin:</p>

       <pre><code class='html'>&lt;script src="path/to/jquery.min.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script src="path/to/jquery.lettering.min.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script>
$(document).ready(function() {
  $(".fancy_title").lettering();
});
&lt;/script></code></pre>

       <p>Contrary to what most people tell you, I put all my script initializers and loaders at the bottom of my file to make sure that there is content loaded before I initialize code that will change it. It's always been a catch 22.  AS:</p>

<p>Web performance patterns advise that you put Javascripts at the bottom of your page before your <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag.  There is an unfortunate side effect where you may experiences a <a href="http://paulirish.com/2009/fighting-the-font-face-fout/">FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text)</a> when you're manipulating your text after the DOM has loaded.  Unfortunately, we found the best solution to avoid/minimize the FOUT caused by this plugin is to put your scripts (jQuery, Lettering.js) in the document <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. On the one hand, your page will load slower. On the other hand, a flash/restyling makes your site feel slow. Users might ultimately feel the site is faster if they don't see the FOUT.</p>

       <p>The result will appear like this:</p>

       <pre><code class="html">&lt;h1 class="fancy_title">
  &lt;span class="char1">S&lt;/span>
  &lt;span class="char2">o&lt;/span>
  &lt;span class="char3">m&lt;/span>
  &lt;span class="char4">e&lt;/span>

  &lt;span class="char9">l&lt;/span>
  &lt;span class="char10">e&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1></code></pre>

       <p>Which then we can style with CSS looking something like this:</p>

       <pre><code class='css'>.fancy_title .ch2 {
         margin-left: -.0125em;
         color: purple;
}</code></pre>

       <p>We can be even more detailed in how we break our content out and how much we style it. In the example below:</p>

       <pre><code class='html'>&lt;h1>My Three Sons&lt;/h1></code></pre>

<pre><code class='html'>&lt;script>
  $("h1").lettering('words').children('span').lettering();
&lt;/script>
</code></pre>

       <p>The lettering invocation will create spans for words and then it will split each word into its component characters, procudinc HTML like the one below:</p>

<pre><code class='html'>&lt;h1>
  &lt;span class="word1">
    &lt;span class="char1">M&lt;/span>
    &lt;span class="char2">y&lt;/span>
  &lt;/span>
  &lt;span class="word2">
    &lt;span class="char1">T&lt;/span>
    &lt;span class="char2">h&lt;/span>
    &lt;span class="char3">r&lt;/span>
    &lt;span class="char4">e&lt;/span>
    &lt;span class="char5">e&lt;/span>
  &lt;/span>
  &lt;span class="word3">
    &lt;span class="char1">S&lt;/span>
    &lt;span class="char2">o&lt;/span>
    &lt;span class="char3">n&lt;/span>
    &lt;span class="char4">s&lt;/span>
  &lt;/span>
&lt;/h1></code></pre>

       <p>Although, as mentioned earlier, this is not good for larger chunks of text the posibilities for headings and smaller pieces of text are only limited by your imagination.</p>

        <p>Open Type fonts have a set of features that make typographical work easier both in print and, where supported, on the web. These features can be enabled. These are a subset of all the Open Type features available. </p>

        </ul>

        <p>Adobe has <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_tag3.html">more information about Open Type features</a>, both the ones listed above and additional features used in desktop publishing. When in doubt use the name above to check Adobe's list.</p>

        <p>To enable these features in CSS use something like the code below:</p>

        <pre><code class=css>body {
  font-feature-settings:
    "c2sc" 0,
    "calt" 1,
    "clig" 1,
    "dlig" 1,
    "frac" 0,
    "hist" 0,
    "hlig" 0,
    "kern" 0,
    "liga" 1,
    "nalt" 0,
    "salt" 1,
    "ss01" 0,
    "ss02" 0,
    "ss03" 0,
    "ss04" 0,
    "ss05" 0,
    "swsh" 0,
    "zero" 0;
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>This feature is a prime candidate for autoprefixer or some other automation tool. Repeating the same sequence of value-pair for 3 or 4 different alternatives is a nightmare; according to <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=font-feature-settings">caniuse.com</a>, Only IE, Chrome/Opera and Firefox support the feature and Chrome/Opera support it behind the -webkit flag.</p>

        <h2><a name='unicode-and-multilingual-support'></a>Unicode and multilingual support</h2>

        <p><a href="http://unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html">Unicode</a> is an ISO international standard (ISO/IEC 10646) for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text in most of the world's writing systems. It answers the question: <strong>How do I combine multiple languages in a single document?</strong></p>

        <p>In the past we had different encodings for different language codified in the ISO/IEC 8859 series of standards. English, for example, uses ISO/IEC 8859-1 which is mostly ASCII. This is not sufficient to work with eastern European languages that use additional symbols accents and punctuation to fully express the language. See the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ISO/IEC_8859">Wikipedia entry for ISO 8859</a> for more details regarding what languages are supported on each section of the standard.</p>

        <p>HTML and XHTML both come with a <a href='http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref'>predefined set of entities</a> to handle unicode characters using a name (for example using &amp;Upsilon; for the uppercase Upsilon greek letter.) But that is still no guarantee that your chosen font will have the glyphs matching the character you need. </p>

        <h2><a name='legal-issues'></a>Legal Issues</h2>

        <p>Unless you own the typeface or it is licensed through Google Fonts or another free service, you will have to pay for the font and be subject to whatever restrictions the EULA (End User License Agreement) specifies. This may be a problem when the foundry decides that you don't need a TTF format for the font you just purchased or when you're not allowed to generate an SVG version of your font to use with older iOS devices.</p>

        <p>I do not mean to say or imply that you should break your license agreement. Quite the opposite; we should be thankful that foundries and font creators have decided that the bennefits outweigh the risks when it comes to online fonts. It is not a perfect solution and we need to keep working at making it better.</p>

        <p>I recently asked a foundry on twitter why didn't they provide certain font formats (the font purchase for web includes EOT and WOFF with TTF as a mockup font) there was no TTF, OTF, SVG or WOFF2 available for me to use. The exchange turned ugly and, from my perspective, ignored completely the fact that I had purchased a license to the font and therefore was in my right to request additional font types to acommodate my userbase... they indicated that they could do it in a special (as in more expensive) license and that they know best what formats of their fonts I will need for my clients based on general usage or that none of his big clients have made the request for TTF so it must mean that there is no need for the format anywhere.</p>

        <p>Font Licensing is like DRM encumbered music. You have the medium but do not own the actual font. As far as I understand it the foundry can terminate your license for any reason and you're not allowed to make changes to suit the fonts to our needs rather than believe the foundries have the answers for everything. Things changed for music files and I can only hope that the same changes will happen with fonts and font licensing.</p>

        <h3><a name='open-source-fonts'></a>Open Source fonts</h3>

        <p>So, if propietary fonts can become such a nightmare will open source fonts work any better?</p>

       <p>The answer, as usual, is it depends.</p>

       <p>There are awesome fonts with open source licenses. Fonts like <a href='http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/raleway'>Raleway</a>, <a href='http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto'>Roboto</a>, <a href='http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=gentium'>Gentium</a> and <a href='http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/fira-sans'>Fira Sans</a> are good open source solutions but, as with everything else related to type, You need to test your chosen fonts with your content and make sure that it works for your particular project and the languages that your document has to support.</p>

        <p>A good starting point, if you're looking for free/open source fonts is the <a href='http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/find_fonts'>free font list</a> from Font Squirrel. You can look at the fonts and download them to test on your local system before you decide if you want to use the font.  You can also check sites like <a href='http://fontsinuse.com/'>Fonts in Use</a> to see other uses of the fonts you're evaluating.</p>

        <figure>

          <figcaption>Example from <a href='fontsinuse.com'>Fonts in Use</a> with samples of sites/apps using Roboto as their font</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>For the most part the free fonts in Font Squirrel can be used with the <a href='http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator'>Webfont Generator</a>. This tool allows you to upload fonts (for which you have license and/or permission) to generate the formats needed to support all browsers (including SVG for all iOS and TTF for older versions of browsers.</p>

        <p><a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-shapes/">CSS Shapes</a> allow designers and content creators to match some magazines layouts where the text wraps around images and other polygonal and irregular shapes.</p>

        <p>Why do I include shapes in an essay about typography? As you can see in the examples below, shapes change the way the text relates to the surrounding images. Imagine what we can do with irregular shapes or letters (thinking of Dropcap applications).It can also be used to create shapes with text <em>inside</em> the shape (although this is not as widely supported)</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/shape-outside-example.jpg" alt="example of text wrapping around shapes in a page">
          <figcaption>Example of text wrapping around shapes in a page</figcaption>
        </figure>
      <div class="css-example">
    <style scoped contenteditable>/* You can edit this text and copy it to your own stylesheet */

div#shapeExample {
  border: 1px solid #cc092f;
  padding: 1em;
  width: 100%;
}
#shapeExample .element{
  shape-outside: url(images/espresso.jpg);
  shape-image-threshold: 0.5;
  float: left;
}
          </style>

          <div id='shapeExample'>
             <img class="element" src="images/espresso.jpg" />
<p>Lorem ipsum…</p>
          </div>
</div>
      <p>Shape outside an image</p>

      <p>In the future we'll be able to use shape outside and <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-exclusions/">exclusions</a> to create magazine equivalent layouts and where creativity will be the driving force, not browser constaints.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be much traction with exclusions or full shapes support within the CSS working group (which means that browsers are far from giving us working implementations) so we have to resort to <a href="https://github.com/adobe-webplatform/css-shapes-polyfill/blob/master/README.md">polyfills</a> for shapes to account for incomplete spec support and older browsers that don't support the feature altogether. I am not a fan of polyfills but, even with all the limitations inherent to polyfills, seems like a good compromise for this particular situation.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/exclusion-example.jpg" alt="Example Layout using Exclusions">

        <p>According to the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/masking/">CSS Masking</a> specification abstract:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>CSS Masking provides two means for partially or fully hiding portions of visual elements: masking and clipping.</p>

      <p><em>Masking</em> describes how to use another graphical element or image as a luminance or alpha mask. Typically, rendering an element via CSS or SVG can conceptually described as if the element, including its children, are drawn into a buffer and then that buffer is composited into the element’s parent. Luminance and alpha masks influence the transparency of this buffer before the compositing stage.</p>

      <p><em>Clipping</em> describes the visible region of visual elements. The region can be described by using certain SVG graphics elements or basic shapes. Anything outside of this region is not rendered.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>It has long been a trivial exercise to create masks and clip path images in Photoshop or Illustrator (and Photoshop CC makes it a really simple &#39;pick the image and click here and here&#39; exercise.) But until clip paths and masks became available in CSS you had to use an external tool to create these effects.</p>

        <p>For those of us who have been playing in/with 'the web' for 10 years or longer remember pages like the ones in the figures below. There was no Javascript and, I believe, the original CSS specification was released in 1996 so there was no CSS to play with.</p>

        <p>Why do I bring this up? Because we've gotten spoiled by reaches. We talk about critical rendering path, page load and web typography and that's good. But we forget that what may be an acceptable page load in Mountain View, California may not be acceptable in Thailand where the dominant form of Internet access is the mobile smart phone (<a href="http://www.techwireasia.com/1152/mobile-internet-users-up-40pc-in-thailand-iphone-dominant/">Tech Wire Asia</a>).</p>

        <p>As Eric Meyer reminds us the web is more than just Javascript, CSS and the latest and greates APIs or micro services. We need to make sure that the content is accessible whether we have CSS and Javascript enabled or whether they are in a broadband Gigabit connection or in a very slow dial up connection in Africa or India or for people using assistive technology devices.</p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r38al1w-h4k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>As content developers we need to continually ask ourselves what would happen if we can't download the CSS or if the user has Javascript disabled. We need to make this a part of our testing and development process.</p>
